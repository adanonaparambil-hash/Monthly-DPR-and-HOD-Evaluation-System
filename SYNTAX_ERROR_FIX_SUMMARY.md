# Syntax Error Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Malformed Method Closure
**Problem**: A method closure was incorrectly merged with console.log statements, causing syntax errors.

**Location**: Line 968 in `emergency-exit-form.component.ts`

**Error**: 
```typescript
  }onsole.log('Form values after patching:', this.exitForm.value);
```

**Fix**: Properly closed the method and removed duplicate code:
```typescript
  }
```

### 2. Duplicate Method Implementation
**Problem**: The `disableEmployeeInfoFields()` method was implemented twice, causing duplicate function implementation errors.

**Locations**: 
- Line 792: First implementation (kept)
- Line 971: Duplicate implementation (removed)

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate method implementation while keeping the more complete version.

## Root Cause
The syntax errors were introduced during the auto-fetch implementation when code was accidentally duplicated and merged incorrectly during the editing process.

## Resolution Steps
1. **Identified malformed closure**: Fixed the method ending that was merged with console.log
2. **Removed duplicate method**: Kept the first, more complete implementation of `disableEmployeeInfoFields()`
3. **Verified fix**: Confirmed no remaining syntax errors with diagnostics

## Files Modified
- `src/app/emergency-exit-form/emergency-exit-form.component.ts` - Fixed syntax errors

## Verification
✅ All syntax errors resolved
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ Auto-fetch functionality preserved
✅ No duplicate method implementations

The emergency exit form component now compiles successfully without any syntax errors while maintaining all the auto-fetch functionality for employee information.
