# Email Integration Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated email functionality into the Monthly DPR component to send emails alongside notifications when DPR status changes occur.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Sending Integration
- Added email sending functionality to existing notification methods
- Emails are sent automatically when notifications are triggered
- Uses the existing `SendEmail` API method from the API service

### 2. Template Keys Implemented
The following template keys are used based on different DPR scenarios:

- **DPR_SUBMISSION_HOD**: When employee submits DPR to HOD
- **DPR_SUBMISSION_EMPLOYEE**: When employee successfully submits DPR (confirmation)
- **DPR_APPROVED**: When HOD approves the DPR
- **DPR_PUSHBACK**: When HOD pushes back DPR for revision

### 3. Email Placeholders
All emails include the following dynamic placeholders:

- **[EmployeeName]**: Employee's full name from `empName` field
- **[EmployeeID]**: Employee ID from `empId` field  
- **[HODName]**: HOD name from reporting dropdown selection
- **[MonthYear]**: Current month/year from header (e.g., "October 2024")
- **[EvaluationFormLink]**: Full URL to view DPR in readonly mode
- **[HODRemarks]**: Management remarks from input field
- **[EmployeeDprEditLink]**: Full URL for employee to edit DPR (for pushback scenarios)

### 4. URL Generation
- Uses `window.location.origin` to dynamically get the base URL
- Constructs full URLs for email links: `${baseUrl}/monthly-dpr/${dprId}?readonly=1`
- For pushback scenarios, provides editable link without readonly parameter

### 5. Email Triggers

#### To HOD:
- Triggered when employee submits DPR (status changes to 'S')
- Sent after successful notification creation

#### To Employee:
- **Submission Confirmation**: When employee submits DPR
- **Approval Notification**: When HOD approves DPR (status 'A')
- **Pushback Notification**: When HOD requests revision (status 'R')

### 6. Methods Added

#### `getBaseUrl()`
- Returns the current application's base URL for email links

#### `sendEmailToHOD(dprId: number)`
- Sends email to HOD when DPR is submitted
- Uses DPR_SUBMISSION_HOD template
- Includes all relevant employee and DPR information

#### `sendEmailToEmployee(dprId: number, isSubmission: boolean)`
- Sends emails to employee for different scenarios
- Template selection based on approval status and submission flag
- Handles submission confirmation, approval, and pushback scenarios

### 7. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling for missing HOD information
- Console logging for successful/failed email sends
- Does not interrupt the main DPR workflow if email fails

## Important Notes

### HOD Email Configuration
The current implementation assumes HOD email is available in the `hodList` structure. You may need to:

1. **Option 1**: Extend the `DropdownOption` interface to include an email field
2. **Option 2**: Create a separate API call to fetch HOD email by ID
3. **Option 3**: Modify the backend to include email in the HOD master list response

### Current Placeholder
The implementation currently uses `hodInfo.description` as both HOD name and email. This should be updated based on your actual data structure.

## Files Modified
- `src/app/monthly-dpr.component/monthly-dpr.component.ts`
  - Added SendEmailRequest import
  - Added getBaseUrl() method
  - Added sendEmailToHOD() method  
  - Added sendEmailToEmployee() method
  - Updated existing notification methods to trigger emails

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test email sending for all DPR status transitions
2. Verify email template placeholders are correctly populated
3. Test URL generation in different environments
4. Verify HOD email retrieval works correctly
5. Test error scenarios (missing HOD info, API failures)

## Future Enhancements
1. Add email preferences/settings for users
2. Implement email templates preview
3. Add email delivery status tracking
4. Support for CC/BCC recipients
5. Email template customization interface
