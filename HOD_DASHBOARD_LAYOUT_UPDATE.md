# HOD Dashboard Layout Update

## Overview
Removed the "Department-Wise Performance" section from the HOD dashboard and repositioned the "Evaluation Summary" section to align next to the "Employee Performance Trends" chart for better layout optimization.

## Changes Made

### 1. **HTML Template Updates** (`src/app/hod-dashboard/hod-dashboard.html`)

#### **Removed Section:**
- **Department-Wise Performance Chart**: Complete removal of the second chart container that displayed cross-department performance metrics
- **Associated Chart Legend**: Removed the legend items for Initiative, Quality, and Timeliness

#### **Repositioned Section:**
- **Evaluation Summary**: Moved from standalone section to be part of the charts-section grid
- **Converted to Chart Container**: Restructured as a chart-container to match the layout pattern
- **Updated Styling**: Applied gsap-chart-card class and chart-glow effect for consistency

### 2. **TypeScript Component Updates** (`src/app/hod-dashboard/hod-dashboard.ts`)

#### **Removed References:**

#### **Maintained Functionality:**
- **Summary Chart**: Kept all existing functionality for the Evaluation Summary chart
- **Performance Trend Chart**: Preserved Employee Performance Trends chart functionality
- **Animations**: All GSAP animations and scroll triggers remain intact

### 3. **Layout Structure**

#### **Before:**
```
charts-section (2 charts side by side)
├── Employee Performance Trends
└── Department-Wise Performance

summary-section (standalone)
└── Evaluation Summary
```

### 6. **Code Cleanup**
- **Removed Unused Code**: Eliminated all references to Department-Wise Performance
