# Fixes Summary - Employee Exit Form Issues

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Radio Button Alignment for Category**
- **Issue**: Category radio buttons (Staff/Worker) were not aligned correctly
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved CSS for `.radio-group` with better spacing and alignment
  - Added hover effects and better visual feedback
  - Made radio buttons more responsive on mobile devices

### 2. **Department Cards Loading Issue**
- **Issue**: Only the first card was loading in Step 3, other cards weren't visible
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced `ensureAllCardsVisible()` method with immediate visibility forcing
  - Added `!important` CSS rules to override any hiding styles
  - Called `ensureAllCardsVisible()` in `ngOnInit()` to ensure cards are visible from start
  - Improved change detection with `cdr.detectChanges()`

### 3. **Form Validation Clearing on Route Switch**
- **Issue**: Validation errors persisted when switching between Emergency and Planned Leave forms
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `clearFormAndReset()` method that:
    - Resets form to step 1
    - Clears all form data
    - Removes all validation errors
    - Resets department statuses
    - Clears approval remarks
    - Resets responsibilities array
  - Called automatically when form type changes via route parameters

### 4. **Navigation to Step 3 for Planned Leave**
- **Issue**: Navigation wasn't working properly for Planned Leave (skipping step 2)
- **Fix**: 
  - Improved `nextStep()` logic to handle both form types correctly
  - For Planned Leave: Step 1 â†’ Step 3 â†’ Step 4
  - For Emergency: Step 1 â†’ Step 2 â†’ Step 3 â†’ Step 4
  - Fixed step validation and progression

### 5. **Submit Button Position**
- **Issue**: Submit button was showing in Step 2, should only show in Step 4
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed condition from `*ngIf="currentStep === totalSteps"` to `*ngIf="currentStep === 4"`
  - Updated Next button condition to `*ngIf="currentStep < 4"`
  - Ensures submit button only appears in final step for both form types

### 6. **Different Declarations for Both Forms**
- **Issue**: Same declarations were used for both Emergency and Planned Leave forms
- **Fix**: 
  - Added conditional declarations using `*ngIf="formType === 'E'"` and `*ngIf="formType === 'P'"`
  - **Emergency Exit Declarations**:
    - Emergency-specific language ("emergency exit", "return as per approved dates")
    - 2-3 business days processing time
  - **Planned Leave Declarations**:
    - Planned leave-specific language ("planned departure", "approved schedule")
    - References the person responsibilities were handed over to
    - 5-7 business days processing time

### 7. **Animated Colorful Icons in Header**
- **Issue**: Header needed visual distinction between form types
- **Fix**: 
  - Added animated icons next to form titles
  - **Emergency Exit**: Red-orange gradient with warning triangle icon and pulse animation
  - **Planned Leave**: Teal-green gradient with calendar-check icon and glow animation
  - Icons are responsive and scale down on mobile devices
  - Added smooth animations with CSS keyframes

### 8. **Dynamic Success Message**
- **Issue**: Success message was generic for both form types
- **Fix**: 
  - Dynamic reference ID: "EEF-" for Emergency, "PLF-" for Planned Leave
  - Form-specific success message text
  - Contextual processing information

### 9. **Enhanced Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Issue**: Some elements weren't properly responsive
- **Fix**:

  - Better radio button alignment on mobile
  - Responsive header layout
  - Touch-friendly button sizes
